# GET-VulnDetect: Graph-Enhanced Transformer for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

GET-VulnDetect is an advanced tool that leverages both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformer-based models to detect vulnerabilities in 
smart contracts. This approach combines the structural properties of smart contracts with the sequential nature
of code execution to provide high accuracy in vulnerability detection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/get-vulndetect.git
   cd get-vulndetect
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your smart contract data in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. **Data Processing**: Run `data_processing.py` to preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python src/data_processing.py
   ```
3. **Model Training**: Train the GET-VulnDetect model using:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

## Methodology

GET-VulnDetect leverages a combined approach of GNNs and transformers to detect vulnerabilities:
- **GNN Module**: Captures structural information of the smart contract.
- **Transformer Module**: Analyzes the sequential execution of code.
- **Fusion Layer**: Combines insights from both GNN and transformer outputs.
